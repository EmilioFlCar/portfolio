Worked on the development of an LMS (Learning Management System) platform created by [**Estanislao Bachrach**](https://www.casadellibro.com.co/libros-ebooks/estanislao-bachrach/20086510) for high-performance athletes. Designed and optimized the MongoDB database, developed RESTful API endpoints, and documented the API to simplify integration. Collaborated closely with the frontend team to ensure its proper implementation.
