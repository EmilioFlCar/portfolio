# About Me

Hi, I'm Emilio — a Fullstack Developer from Colombia with a passion for building meaningful digital experiences. I specialize in crafting web applications using modern technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, Supabase, and PostgreSQL.

I enjoy solving problems through clean, scalable code and intuitive design. Whether it’s building tools for sustainable agriculture, preserving regional culture through technology, or creating systems that simplify complex tasks, I aim to build software that creates real value.

I’m constantly learning, exploring new tools, and refining my skills. Right now, I’m focused on projects that merge technology with purpose — especially those that empower communities or promote sustainability.

When I’m not coding, I’m likely reading something deep, sketching ideas, or planning how to turn the next big concept into a working prototype.

Let’s build something impactful.
