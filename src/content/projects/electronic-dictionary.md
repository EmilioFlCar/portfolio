Worked on the development of the Electronic Dictionary of the Popular Speech of the Sin√∫ and San Jorge River Valleys, a project focused on preserving regional linguistic traditions. I built a robust API with Node.js and Express.js, integrated MongoDB for data storage, and configured AWS S3 for image management. Additionally, I developed the frontend using Vue.js and Bulma for an interactive experience, implemented JWT for secure authentication, and deployed the platform for public use.
